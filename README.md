Predicting Cancer and Multiple Sclerosis risk using genomic mapping and demographics

This tool maps DNA sequences via BLAST to identify pathogenic mutations in genes 
like BRCA1 (Cancer) and HLA-DRB1 (MS), combining genetic findings with 
demographic risk factors.

- BLAST XML parser for mutation identification.
- Demographic variables (Smoking, Vit D, Age).
- Forecast model providing a percentage risk score.

This is a research project for educational purposes and is not a clinical diagnostic tool.
